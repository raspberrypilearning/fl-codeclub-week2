## The Code Club projects

In Week 1, we focussed on the practicalities of what you need to get ready before you start a Code Club. Now, let's think about what the young people will do when they sit down at their keyboards each week.

## Our projects
Code Club provide [projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/codeclub) for the club members to work through, so we've taken all the work out of deciding what to do at your club sessions.

Each project allows you to create an animation, a game, or a webpage, guiding you through the process of coding step by step. Each takes approximately an hour to complete — the perfect length for a Code Club session.

The projects:

+ Introduce key coding concepts
+ Encourage challenge-based learning
+ Enable learners to build up programming skills as they progress through each project guide
+ Are unique, each one helping learners to create something different and original

## Languages
Code Club have projects available for:

+ Scratch
+ Python
+ HTML/CSS
+ Sonic Pi

Moreover, we also provide projects for learning to use the [Sense HAT](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/sense-hat/), a scientific add-on board for the Raspberry Pi.

> *The Code Club projects guide the students so they learn without realising. They gain skills week by week so that, by the end of a course, they have mastered the basics of a coding language and have understood that this is just the beginning. [...] Starting with Scratch, students can then move onto text-based languages like Python or HTML, transferring the concepts they have mastered by tackling their own ideas and turning them into reality, be that a crazy Scratch game, a sparkling new web page, or a physical computing project with all the bells and whistles.*
