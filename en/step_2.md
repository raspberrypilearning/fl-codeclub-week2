## Your experiences at an extracurricular club

Code Club is designed to work as an informal after-school or lunchtime club. The idea is that the club sessions should feel different to school lessons.

This week we'll be focusing on how to run your Code Club sessions. To help get you thinking about what these sessions might be like, think about your own experiences in extracurricular clubs as a child.

## Reflection
Did you go to a club after school, during lunchtime, or on the weekend when you were a child? What did you do there?
