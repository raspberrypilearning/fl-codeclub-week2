## Your experiences at an extracurricular club

Code Club is designed to work as an informal after-school or lunchtime club. The idea is that the club sessions should feel different to school lessons.

This week we'll be focussing on how to run your Code Club sessions. To help get you thinking about what these sessions might be like, join the discussion below about your own experiences in extracurricular clubs as a child.
