## Try out another Code Club project

Choose one of these three projects:

[Scratch: Rock band](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rock-band){:target="_blank"}
— learn how to code your own musical instruments using Scratch.

[HTML/CSS: Happy birthday](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/happy-birthday){:target="_blank"}
— learn how to make a customised online birthday card.

[Python: About me](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/about-me){:target="_blank"}
— write about and create pictures of yourself.

Each project will take about 20–30 minutes to complete depending on your prior experience.

We strongly recommend that prior to each week's club, you take some time to complete the project yourself to have the best possible idea of what might go wrong and where your learners may 'get stuck'.
