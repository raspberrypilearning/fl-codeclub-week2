## How will you start your first session?

First things first: you should start your first session by introducing yourself and explaining to your new club members what Code Club is.

If the club members don’t already know you, you can also say something about yourself. For example, tell them why you are interested in coding.

Once introductions have been taken care of, there are several different ways to kick off your session.  [Rohima Crook](https://www.futurelearn.com/profiles/8462001){:target="_blank"}, Code Club Programme Manager, has some suggestions for you:

## Show a completed version of the project

If most children of the group are going to be working on the same project, it’s a good idea to first show them a completed version of it. Of course, if you’ve worked through the project yourself, you can show your version. This is a tangible way of demonstrating to the children what their aim for the session is, and it may even help them come up with ideas for how they can extend the project.

## Demonstrate a small section of a project

If you’ve worked through a project before the club session, you may have found a section which you think would be worth demonstrating before everyone starts. Spending a few minutes demonstrating skills or ideas at the beginning of the session allows the children to work more independently as the session progresses.

## Look at some online Scratch projects

This suggestion may be a little controversial, as I know some clubs actively encourage their children to create their own games instead of playing those made by other people. However, it can be really valuable for the children to spend a few minutes exploring some online projects because it can help them to understand the potential of Scratch and to be inspired. You can focus this activity by suggesting children search around a keyword for projects relating to a particular theme, such as ‘nature’ or ‘holidays’.

## Name badges

If you don’t already know the club members, you can give them name badges to help you learn their names. Once you are part of an **active** Code Club, you will be able to download a name badge template when you log into your account.

If you’re not good at learning names, don’t worry. You can keep the badges and hand them out again at the start of the next session.

## Establish a routine

Several clubs I’ve visited have a routine for the children to follow when they arrive. This often includes tasks such as getting a laptop, collecting login details, setting up their computer, and reviewing what they did last week. After the first two or three sessions, this becomes second nature and frees up the adults helping at the club to answer any individual queries that might come up.

## Talk about how to support each other

Code Clubs work best when adults support children and children support other children. Sometimes you might need to define what this support looks like and get agreement from everyone in the club. It’s a good idea to talk through club rules, such as what to do if you get stuck, and how to test each other’s projects out.

Week 3 of this course looks in more detail at establishing club rules.

A dynamic short introduction prepares the way for the rest of the session to run smoothly. When clubs start their sessions well, it makes the children excited about the creative opportunities that coding offers, and it helps them develop a resilient approach to problem-solving.

## Off you go!

Don’t spend too long on your introductions — perhaps pick one or two of the ideas above. The learners will be keen to get started on the projects!

# Discussion
