## What does a Code Club look like?

Watch this video of a typical session from one club in the South of England. As you can see, the young people in this club use the projects throughout the session, and they are allowed to choose which programming language to learn and which project to work through.

Many clubs are run by one teacher, or by one teacher and one volunteer. However, the one in the video is a club where a group of volunteers work together with one teacher. Sometimes they all attend the sessions, and sometimes they take turns. Volunteering in a group can work well, and many people team up with colleagues or friends to volunteer and share the time commitment.
