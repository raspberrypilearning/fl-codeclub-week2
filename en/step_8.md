## Your first session

So it's time to start thinking about your first session. If you're feeling a bit nervous, don't worry â€” that's completely normal. Just remember you've done lots of preparation already, and the Code Club resources and community are there to support you.

###What will you do in the first session?
First of all, make sure you have decided whether you will be coding in Scratch, Python, HTML/CSS, or Sonic Pi. Then all you need to do is choose which Code Club project you'll be starting off with.

The Code Club projects increase in difficulty as they go along, and they build on skills gained in previous weeks, so starting with the first project in the language you have chosen makes sense.

You probably completed one of these projects earlier on in the course, and if you haven't, then running through one yourself before the first session with the club members will be great preparation; it will really help you answer the questions that come up during the session.

### The structure of the first session
However you decide to use the projects in your sessions, it is a good idea to stick to the basic idea of giving your session a clear **beginning, middle, and end**.

In the next step, we'll explore in detail how to start off your first session.

I put a sticky note with each child's name on the edge of their laptops or computer screens. They're easier to see than name badges when you're standing behind them in the classroom.<br><br><span style= "text-align:right; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">Tracy Gardner, Code Club leader, Oliver's Battery Primary School, Winchester.</span>
